# Play 2.0 RC1

Play 2.0 is a Java and Scala Web application framework (http://www.playframework.org/2.0).

## Installing

For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. On UNIX systems will be something like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play20
```

On windows systems you'll need to set it in the global environment variables.

> If youâ€™re on UNIX, make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play).

## Getting started

Enter any existing Play 2.0 application directory and use the `play` command to launch the development console:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play
```

You can also directly use `play run` to run the application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/myApplication
$ play run
```

Use `play new yourNewApplication` to create a new application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace
$ play new myNewApplication
```

Once the application is created, use it as any existing application:

```bash
$ cd myNewApplication
$ play
```

## Running the sample applications

There are several samples applications included in the `samples/` directory. For example, to run the included ZenTask sample application:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/play2/samples/scala/zentasks/
$ play run
```
> The application will be available on port 9000. On first run, it will notify you that database evolutions are required. Click "Apply this script now" and you're away!
